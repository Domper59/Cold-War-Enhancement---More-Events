Although I've done, with [ccfox](https://github.com/ccfox) 's help, some of the event additions on the Soviet Union and Communist Greece, my goal here is to try and do what I was going to add in the Cold War Enhancement mod.
However, well aware that all this will be quite heavy, I intend to set up a sort of patch list by country/situation that people can choose from according to what they want to do.

The mod does share the discord with CWE, but we ask you to report bugs on the GitHub as well: https://github.com/Domper59/Cold-War-Enhancement---More-Events/issues
